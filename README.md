# web_server

This is a web server based on the data of a person (first name, last name, DOB) which handles user inputs as C.R.U.D operations on a database where the person data is stored.
The user can click one of the available buttons (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to access the relative database operation page.
Once data has been inputed by the user, the data and relative C.R.U.D operation is used to operate on the database. 
To view the success of an operation, the user can click 'Read' to view the changes made.
