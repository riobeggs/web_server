# web_server

This web server is based on a person's data (first name, last name, DOB) which handles user inputs as C.R.U.D operations on a database where the personal data is stored. To access the relative database operation page, the user can click one of the available buttons (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Once data has been input by the user, the data and relative C.R.U.D operation is used to operate on the database. To view the success of an operation, the user can click 'Read' to view the changes made.
